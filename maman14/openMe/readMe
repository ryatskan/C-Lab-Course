=============================
This is the 14 Maman. 
I've written it using Clion, then made adjustment for makefile compilcation with the -pedantic flag.
read the "maman 14" rules first, I explain here the implemenation so it wont be 42 pages long..

The Project consists of 3 main stages:
1. the pre-assembler-run: 
	a. input: a given file.
	b. output: a new file.
	
	c. transform the file into an array of lines ("lines"). 
	   then, the lines arr will be cleaned from tabs, reduntant spaces and empty lines.
	   then, for each macro decleration, the run will replace each macro call with the macro code. (and remove the declaration).
	   print the lines into a new file with suffix ".am".

2. the first pass:
	a. input: lines
	b. output: a Sentence array ("sentences"), machineWordImg, symbolTable.

	c. iterate over each line in lines.
	   read each line synatx (label, operands, operators) and transform it into a processed Sentence struct, for easier semantics
	   processing.
	   then, process each Sentence, depending on its specific label, operand, operators.. into machineWords 
	   (capsulated as a single machineWordCapsule) and entries in symbolTable (if needed).
	   Most of the machineWords are complete, some are flaged to be filled in the second pass.
	   
3. the second pass:
	a. input: sentences, machineWordImg, symbolTable from fpass.
	b. output: 3 files
	c. iterate over each Sentence in sentences, and if the sentence has correspoding machineWords that are flaged, fill them.
	   also flag each Sentence with ".entry" operand inside the symbolTable, and create a table keeping track of 
	   machineWords correspoding to ".external" Sentence (externalTable).
	   print the complete machineWordImg, entries in symbolTable and externalTable to 3 new files.

NOTE: the above mentioned assumes input is correct, fpass and spass also looks for errors in the input
      and only output the error if found.

NOTE: working directory is "files"

Tests Handling:
A folder contains a test about pre-assembler
B folder contains tests about error handling
C folder contains a test of an error-free run.
